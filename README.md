# LeagueChatBuff

This app uses an account to login to Riot's League of Legends chat client and send automated messages to users while ingame.
Players can send messages to the bot through the in-game chat to create timers for in-game events. This bot will send update messages
on the timer every 1 minute until coutdown is complete for each timer. 

This can be used to track flashes and other abilities that you know the cooldowns for.
